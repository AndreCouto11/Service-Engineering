# Service-Engineering
This project, developed in collaboration with two other colleagues using React and Django, aimed to apply service design techniques to model a service. The primary goals included gaining an understanding of the complexity of services and the importance of using these techniques. We focused on developing competencies in diagnosing and evolving existing services, as well as designing new ones. Additionally, we applied cloud-based technologies to create a service that is simple, powerful, responsive, well-designed, and visually appealing. This project was carried out as part of a Master's degree in Engineering and Data Science.
